## tools needed

		bedtool     tool to manipulate bed files

### After getting sequence from bed files or fasta(sequences) file given as input

	

## 

1) generate all permutation of 'ATGC' for 2 to 6 position
	  
2) calculate permutations frequencies and statistical parameters for each sequence
           
3) predict sequence label using model
          
4) Deliver result
